## The Problem

### The cost of not responding fast

> ⏱️ According to a [MIT study](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads), companies that respond to leads within **5 minutes** are **100x more likely** to connect with them than those that wait 30 minutes or more.

Most sales teams respond hours or days later.
