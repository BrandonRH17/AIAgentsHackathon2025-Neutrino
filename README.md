## Reinventing how high-ticket businesses sell — through AI agents that turn every customer interaction into a high-converting conversation.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

High-ticket buyers receive the same one-size-fits-all content, leading to:
- Disengagement
- Longer sales cycles
- Missed opportunities

Meanwhile, agents are overwhelmed with:
- Repetitive tasks like quoting
- Manual follow-ups via WhatsApp or Google Sheets
- 100+ quotes created to close just **one** deal
