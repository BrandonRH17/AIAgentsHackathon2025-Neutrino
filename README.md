## Reinventing how high-ticket businesses sell — through AI agents that turn every customer interaction into a high-converting conversation.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

High-ticket buyers receive the same one-size-fits-all content, leading to:
- Disengagement
- Longer sales cycles
- Missed opportunities

Meanwhile, agents are overwhelmed with:
- Repetitive tasks like quoting
- Manual follow-ups via WhatsApp or Google Sheets
- 100+ quotes created to close just **one** deal

| The agent replies with the same generic PDF as 10 others. | The agent replies with the same generic PDF as 20 others. |
| If there's interest, they manually build a quote in Google Sheets and follow up via WhatsApp. | If interested, a manual quote is built in Google Sheets and followed up via WhatsApp. |

## 📉 The cost of *not* responding fast

> ⏱️ According to a [MIT study](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads), companies that respond to leads within **5 minutes** are **100x more likely** to connect with them than those that wait 30 minutes or more.

Yet most agents respond hours—or days—later.

**Tasker solves this by responding instantly, 24/7, with personalized content that moves the deal forward.**
