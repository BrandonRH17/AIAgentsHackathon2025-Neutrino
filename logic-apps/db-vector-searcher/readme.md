## `db-vector-searcher`

This Logic App is responsible for providing our AI agent with the contextual information it needs to assist real estate advisors or trigger other internal tools.

### üîç Functionality

It receives two main inputs:
- **`entity_type`**: Indicates the type of entity to search (`property`, `project`, or `client`).
- **`query`**: The natural language query that will be vectorized.

The Logic App then:
1. Embeds the query using **Azure OpenAI embeddings**.
2. Performs a **vector search** against the appropriate table based on the entity type.
3. Returns the most relevant matches from the vector store.

## üß© Rationale Behind the Search Architecture

- **Varying Entity Dimensions**: Projects typically have 2‚Äì3 active records, clients can exceed 100 monthly entries, and properties can surpass 400. Separating the vector search per entity ensures higher precision, reduces noise, and optimizes database performance.
- **Relational Structure for Data Insertion**: Maintaining a relational structure facilitates easier and safer data insertion via the **Retool frontend**, preserving clarity in data visualization and preventing conflicts during query execution.
